# TextExtractor 

A small app to read text from screenshots while fullscreen gaming through hotkey and outputs as .txt file for OBS Studio to pickup and update Text Sources. 

## Conception

I was trying out Vertical streaming to YouTube (and Facebook) while playing Assassin's Creed Origins and using Aitum Vertical. I managed to setup a basic scene where my game was *cloned* as a backdrop and to show and *zoom* on the current quest. The problem is, having the *zoomed* cropped region looks disorienting as the title gets long sometimes, and or is unavailable (blank) leaving an extra region of *zoomed* gameplay.

This was a quick coding using Tesseract OCR and WPF so every value is hardcoded.
